# Proposals For Incubation on [jupyter-incubator](https://github.com/jupyter-incubator)


## Overview

Project Jupyter is organized as a set of Subprojects that are each a GitHub
repository with a development team that follows the Jupyter governance, license and
contribution model. Officially supported and maintained subprojects are hosted on
the [jupyter](https://github.com/jupyter) GitHub organization.

Incubation refers to the process of a Subproject initially being developed outside
the official Jupyter organization. The
[jupyter-incubator](https://github.com/jupyter-incubator) GitHub organization is
maintained and managed by Project Jupyter as one possible location where Subproject
can be incubated. The [New Subproject
Process](https://github.com/jupyter/governance/blob/master/newsubprojects.md)
document in the Jupyter [governance](https://github.com/jupyter/governance)
repository details the process of incubation, the process of incorporation into the
main Jupyter organization and the criteria for incorporation.


## Incubation process

This repository is used for incubation proposals. To initiate this process:

1. Read the [New Subproject Process](https://github.com/jupyter/governance/blob/master/newsubprojects.md)
   to see if incubation on [jupyter-incubator](https://github.com/jupyter-incubator) is appropriate for your new Subproject (it might not be). If is doubt, please send an email to the main Jupyter list asking for input.
3. Pick a name for your new Subproject that is free of trademark problems, follows the
   naming patterns and conventions used in the project and respects the work of others
   even when there are no explicit trademark problems. In general the project favors
   functional names that indicate what the Subproject actually does.
4. Find an Advocate for your Subproject who is an active Steering Council member.
5. Create a pull request on this repository by copying the `template` directory
   into a new directory with the name of your proposed subprojet.
6. In that pull request fill out the `proposal.md` document in that subdirectory.
7. Announce your proposal for incubation to the community for the main Jupyter list.


## Incorporation process

Incorporation refers to the process of an incubating Subproject becoming an officially
maintained and developed part of Project Jupyter. The incorporation process is described
in the [New Subproject
Process](https://github.com/jupyter/governance/blob/master/newsubprojects.md) document.
